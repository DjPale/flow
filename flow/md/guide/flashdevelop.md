###Install

You'll need the [latest development build](http://flashdevelop.org/downloads/builds/) of FlashDevelop.

Double click the `.fdz` file that you downloaded for the template project. This will make a new template project show up in FD when you choose `File -> New Project`.

Restart Flashdevelop to finish the installation.
